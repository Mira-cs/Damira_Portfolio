    <h3>Cartoon that makes you rethink your life purpose </h3>
    <img src="./bojack-horseman.png" alt="a picture of Bojack Horseman cartoon character" />
    <article>What if I told you that the best tv-series of all time (in my opinion) is a tv-series about a world, where animals are humanised?Where the main character is a horse?It sounds silly, but the topics they raise are far from it.</article>

    <h3>Have you ever wondered what happens after you die?</h3>
    <img src="./death-parade.jpg" alt="a poster of anime called Death Parade" />
    <article>I have to admit, I am a fan of anime. There is a prejudice that anime is for kids, but I would strongly disagree with that.”Death Parade” for example, provides its own idea of how people’s fates are decided after death.Do they go to hell or heaven?</article>

    <h3>Do victims of bullying ever recover and move on?</h3>
    <img src="./the-glory.jpg" alt="a poster of korean drama The Glory" />
    <article>Watching “The Glory” made me think deeply about it. This story is about a victim of the worst high-school bullying case, a girl named Dongeun.I admired her perseverance and strength through this whole ordeal.It makes you think about all of the real life cases of abuse in general.Do victims ever get to live a normal life?Or do they carry their pain with them wherever they go?</article>

    <h3>A tv-series that makes you feel good about yourself</h3>
    <img src="./schitts-creek.jpeg" alt="a poster of a tv-series called Schitts Creek" />
    <article>There’s no doubt in my mind that “Schitt’s Creek” is the best comedy tv-series of all time.It has everything:it makes you laugh,cry and cheer for the characters through all the 6 seasons.The character growth they go through is tremendous.</article>

<h3>Do we all have the same struggles?</h3>
<img src="./anxious-people.jpeg" alt="a cover of the book by Fredrik Backman, Anxious People" />
<article>If someone asked me what book I would take with me to a remote island, I would say “Anxious people” by Fredrik Backman.My electronic copy of the book has so many highlighted quotes, that if I read them all out loud you would probably think I am reciting the whole novel to you!</article>
