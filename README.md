**Purpose:**  
To test and showcase the knowledge of HTML&CSS acquired throghout the first two weeks of the course, as well as connecting with people who are on the same journey as I am.In addition,my website would be a perfect tool like any other social media platform, where I can present myself and give people an idea of who I am.  
  
**3.Functionality/Features:**    
At a first glance my website has a very simplistic design and aesthetics.I chose pastel colors for the background and the banner image to make it more pleasant to look at for the viewers eyes.I also chose **Playfair Display** and **Libre Baskerville** fonts for that reason,they are easy to read whilst looking unique.All the pages are **Desktop,Table and Mobile Responsive**.I made the sections position differently on each screen so that the content flows logically,I made fonts/images bigger or smaller depending on the size of the screen too.All the images' brightness have been adjusted so that its not too harsh/bright for the viewers eyes.Some of the text sections are separated from the rest by borders, to let the viewer know that the topics covered are different from the previous sections.
In the top there is a personal icon with my initials on it and Navigation bar.I positioned **Navbar** and **personal icon Navigation menu** on the top of the page so that it's obvious from the first look at the page what the website is about,what information to expect and where to locate it.**Navigation bar** is self-explanatory, we have **"Home"**,which brings you to the root page of the website,**"About Me"**, to read more about my general background and interests,**"Work&Education"**,to dig deeper into my professional background,and **"My Blog"** is a page that contains 5 blog posts.They are named this way for people to see and understand what to expect from each page and navigate throughout the website without any confusion.  
On the **"Homepage"** page,there is an **Introduction** as to who I am, and the purpose of my website.I included the image of myself there as well for people to be able to connect the information presented with the image of me in their minds.  
I expected someone who stumbles upon my website to not know what it is about at first.Putting the **Introduction** at the top of the page would eliminate that.
To the bottom of that section there is my contact information,which flows smoothly from the **Introduction** section.I decided to include a **Contact Information** section there because I mention in the Introduction that the viewer could contact me at anytime.So if anyone wanted to do so immeadiately, there is a contact information right there.  
In the last section of the **Homepage** there are previews of my blog posts.They include a title,date and a read more link, that leads to **"My Blog"** page.It was important for me to include it on the homepage because since a lot of people do not check out other pages of the website and only the homepage,so I wanted people to read the titles,get intrigued by it, follow the link and read the the blog.Hence, increasing the user engagement throughout the entire website.Each post contains an anchor tag that is underlined when hovered over,to show users that the link is clickable.
Every webpage contains the navbar with social links in the bottom.I made sure viewers could visit my socials from every page of the website.The reason behind it is that I would want to connect with as many people as I can,and them seeing the links on every page would make it very accessible.  
On the second page in the Navigation Bar,**"About Me"**,there are two sections.The first paragraph contains general information about my experiences and where I come from.It has a header "What made me who I am", to show viewers that this section includes an important information about me."What I love" section is also self-explanatory, it is about my hobbies.I included the pictures of my hometown and the college I attended in the bottom of the page,so that viewers would read the text above first.  
**"Work&Education"** page provides summary of my professional background.There is a list of texts stacked on top of each other chronologically for the reader to understand the order of the events, as well as pictures of the places I have worked at with captions to get an idea of my professinal experiences.In case anyone wanted to get a further look, I included my resume, by embedding a pdf file into the image,that leads you to a new tab to view it,because I wouldnt want people to leave my website.
The image has initials "CV" on it for better understanding what it is for.
Finally, we have **"My Blog"** page that includes 5 blog posts with dates it was published at.I included images in each blog post to make a visual presentation of what the articles are about.I decided to write about my favorite pieces of media because I mentioned before that I love watching movies and reading books.Plus, writing about the things I like would make viewers relate to me on some level,maybe they would discover we share the same interests.Each post has its own container with borders so that its easy to visually differentiate and separate them.

**6.Target Audience**  
  
**Peers & Colleagues**  
People who are on the same page with me, potentially my classmates and in the future co-workers,might be interested in taking a look at my website and maybe give me some feedback.I am always open to that, and am looking for improving my skills.
  
**Potential Employees**  
It's a good opportunity to showcase my professional and personal background to the hiring manager.It would stand out from all the other resumes people apply with.The hiring company would get to see many aspects of my life that are not presented in the CV.  
  
**General Public**  
I would be happy if anyone would be interested to browse my website,maybe find something we have in common and connect with me.  
  
**Friends**   
My website would provide a more in-depth view of my background, skills and interests.It would be a good opporunity for the people in my life to learn more about me.

**7.Tech Stack**  

**HTML** was used to build the "skeleton" of the website, all the text and visual elements.  
**CSS** was used to style the text/images and to position them effectively on the website.     
**Vercel** was used to deploy a website.I chose Versel due to the simplicity of the whole process and speed.
